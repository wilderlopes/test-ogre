# To test ogre github app

This repository contains a simple test app that demonstrates interaction with the `ogre-cli` tool.

## Installation

To run the application, you need to install the following packages:

- **pytorch**
- **matplotlib**
- **streamlit**
- **ogre-cli**
- **numpy**
- **torch**

You can install these packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pytorch matplotlib streamlit ogre-cli numpy torch
```

## Running the app

Once the packages are installed, you can run the app using the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will launch a web server and open a browser window with the app.

## Usage

The app simply prints a greeting message and displays the version of the `streamlit` package. You can modify the `app.py` file to add more functionality or interact with the `ogre-cli` tool.
